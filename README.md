# Helmet-Detection-for-Bike-Riders-using-YOLO5
A real-time *computer vision project* that detects whether a *bike rider is wearing a helmet or not* using the *YOLOv5 deep learning model*.  
This project aims to enhance *road safety* by providing an automated solution for traffic monitoring systems.

## Project Overview
Two-wheeler riders not wearing helmets are at high risk of head injuries during accidents.  
Manual monitoring by traffic police is difficult and time-consuming.  
This project automates the process using *YOLO (You Only Look Once)* — a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm.

The model can detect:
- ✅ Riders wearing helmets  
- ❌ Riders not wearing helmets  
- 🏍 Motorbikes  
- 👤 Persons  

## Features
- Detects *helmet, **no-helmet, **motorbike, and **person*
- Works on *images* and *videos*
- Real-time detection using *YOLOv5*
- Interactive *Streamlit web interface*
- Ready for *GitHub + Streamlit Cloud* or *Hugging Face* deployment
